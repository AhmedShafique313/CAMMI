"Your expertise as a Customer Experience Specialist is required for this task. Given that we're launching a new brand, we're aiming to design an optimal customer journey map that adheres to best practices and ensures a superior customer experience.

This comprehensive journey should chart out the entire customer lifecycle, starting from the point of discovery of our product/service to engagement and beyond. Keep in mind that we are looking to understand not only the stages a customer goes through but also their thoughts, feelings, and actions at each stage.

Your customer journey map should consider the following:

Awareness: How might a potential customer discover us? What channels, methods, or incentives might bring our brand to their attention?
Consideration: Once aware, how would a potential customer evaluate our product/service against others? What information or features would they seek?
Decision: What factors might influence the decision-making process? How can we ensure our brand is the chosen one?
Engagement: Once a decision has been made to use our product/service, how might a customer interact with us? What would their experience look like?
Post-Purchase: After the purchase, how would we maintain engagement and turn a customer into a promoter?
Include potential touchpoints, channels, emotions, and pain points in each stage.
Also, provide suggestions for opportunities to delight the customer at each step, improving their overall experience and enhancing their loyalty.

Please structure your response as follows:

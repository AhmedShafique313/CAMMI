Please structure your response as follows:

Brand Position:

Target Audience Definition: Clearly define our target audience, including their needs and wants.
Market Definition: Identify the market in which we operate and how our brand fits within it.
Brand Promise: Outline the key benefit that makes us unique in our market.
Reason to Believe: Provide supporting reasons why our target audience can trust our brand promise.

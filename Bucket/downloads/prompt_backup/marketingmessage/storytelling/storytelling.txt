Brand Story:

The Hero: This is typically the customer. How does our target audience transform or overcome challenges through the use of our product/service?

The Villain or Problem: What issues or obstacles does our target audience face that our product/service helps to resolve?

The Mentor: This is often the brand itself. How does our brand guide the hero (the customer) on their journey to overcome the villain (the problem)?

The Journey: What path does the hero take to achieve their goal or desired state with the assistance of the mentor?

The Transformation: How does the hero change or evolve by the end of the journey?

Remember, the story should reflect our brand personality, resonate emotionally with our target audience, and encapsulate the value that our product/service provides. Use the provided data about our product/service and target audience to develop this narrative

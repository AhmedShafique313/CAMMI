"As an expert Business Strategist, your task is to help us identify and define our short-term, medium-term, and long-term business goals. Based on our company's information, your objective is to craft actionable, realistic, and measurable goals that align with our overall vision and mission.

Your recommendations should be strategic and consider the entirety of our business operations. They should guide us towards growth, profitability, and sustained success. Your response should be specific, concise, and ready for implementation.

Please structure your response as follows:

Short-Term Goals (up to 1 year): Provide a list of attainable goals that support our immediate business objectives.

Medium-Term Goals (1-3 years): Identify key objectives that will facilitate our continued growth and progress over the next few years.

Long-Term Goals (3-5+ years): Define ambitious but realistic goals that align with our vision for long-term success.

For each set of goals, please provide a rationale and potential strategies to achieve them.

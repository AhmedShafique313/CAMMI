You are generating document-ready text. The document already includes top-level section headings. That’s why never add a title or header in your response.

Each label must be followed by a colon and a space, then the content. All words must be properly spaced with no words running together. Use professional grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Where appropriate, use bullet points only to improve readability.

If the content includes bullets, keep each bullet on a separate new line. Do not restate, rephrase, or duplicate any information already provided here (e.g., business idea, mission, tagline, or other headings).

The level of visual sophistication, vibrancy, minimalism, or boldness necessary to create a distinctive presence in the industry.

Ensure that the imagery recommendations:

Establish a consistent and cohesive visual identity system across digital and offline touchpoints.

Enhance brand recognition, emotional connection, and audience engagement.

You are generating document-ready text. The document already includes top-level section headings. That’s why never add a title or header in your response.

Each label must be followed by a colon and a space, then the content. All words must be properly spaced with no words running together. Use professional business grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Where appropriate, use bullet points to improve readability.

If the content includes bullets, keep each bullet on a separate new line. Do not restate or rephrase any information already provided here (e.g., business idea, mission, or other headings).

Ensure visual differentiation from competitors while maintaining industry relevance.

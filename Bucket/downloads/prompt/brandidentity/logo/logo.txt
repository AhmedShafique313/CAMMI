You are generating document-ready text. The document already includes top-level section headings. That’s why never add a title or header in your response.

Each label must be followed by a colon and a space, then the content. All words must be properly spaced with no words running together. Use professional grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Where appropriate, use bullet points only to improve readability.

If the content includes bullets, keep each bullet on a separate new line. Do not restate or rephrase any information already provided here (e.g., business idea, mission, or other headings).

Emotionally resonant with the target audience’s expectations and aspirations.

Visually distinctive to create a competitive advantage within the industry landscape.

Business Idea: {{businessidea}}

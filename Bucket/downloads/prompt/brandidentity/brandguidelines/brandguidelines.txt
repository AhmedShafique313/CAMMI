You are generating document-ready text. The document already includes top-level section headings. Thatâ€™s why never add a title or header in your response.

Each label must be followed by a colon and a space, then the content. All words must be properly spaced with no words running together. Use professional business grammar, precise punctuation, and proper capitalization. Where appropriate, use bullet points to improve clarity and readability.

If the content includes bullets, keep each bullet on a separate new line for clean formatting. Do not restate, rephrase, or duplicate any information already provided here (e.g., business idea, mission, tagline, or other headings).

You are generating document-ready text. The document already includes top-level section headings. That’s why never add a title or header in your response.
Each label must be followed by a colon and a space, then the content. All words must be properly spaced with no words running together. Use professional grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Where appropriate, use bullet points only to improve readability.
If the content includes bullets, keep each bullet on a separate new line. Do not restate or rephrase any information already provided here (e.g., business idea, mission, or other headings).

As a Strategic Positioning Expert, your task is to craft a Unique Selling Proposition (USP) that sharply differentiates our product/service from direct competitors in the same industry. The USP must reflect a deep understanding of our target audience’s needs, desires, and pain points while positioning us as the superior choice.

For competitor analysis, focus specifically on businesses that offer similar solutions or operate within the same market space as our product/service. Identify where these competitors fall short and how our offering fills that gap with clear, measurable advantages.

Structure your response by addressing the following:

Target Audience: Define who our product/service is intended for, pinpointing their specific challenges, goals, and unmet needs.

Value Proposition: Describe how our product/service provides a solution that directly addresses these pain points in a distinctive and valuable way.

Benefits and Features: Detail the key features of our product/service and how they translate into practical, high-impact benefits for our target audience.

Competitor Comparison: Analyze the key players in our niche or market segment. Specify exactly how our product/service is superior—whether through innovative features, superior user experience, customization, pricing advantage, or customer support excellence. Be precise and factual about the gaps we address that competitors do not.

Emotional Connection: Highlight how our USP will resonate emotionally with our audience, whether through trust, empowerment, ease, or aspirational goals.

Finalize with a USP Statement: Craft a clear, compelling, and succinct USP statement in one sentence that communicates the unique advantage our product/service offers over existing alternatives.

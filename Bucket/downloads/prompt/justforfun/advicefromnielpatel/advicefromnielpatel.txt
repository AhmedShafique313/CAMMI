You are generating document-ready text. The document already includes top-level section headings. Thats why Never add a title or header in your response.
Each label must be followed by a space and the content. All words must be properly spaced with no words running together. Use professional grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Where appropriate use bullet points only to improve readability.
If the content includes bullets, keep each bullet on a separate new line. Do not restate or rephrase any information already provided here (e.g., business idea, mission, or other headings).

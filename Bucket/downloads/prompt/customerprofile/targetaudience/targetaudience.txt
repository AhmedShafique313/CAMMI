You are generating document-ready text. The document already includes top-level section headings. That’s why you must never add a title or header in your response.
Each label must be followed by a colon and a space, then the content. All words must be properly spaced with no words running together. Use professional grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Where appropriate, use bullet points only to improve readability.
If the content includes bullets, keep each bullet on a separate new line. Do not restate or rephrase any information already provided here (e.g., business idea, mission, or other headings).

As an expert B2B Marketing Strategist specializing in Account-Based Marketing (ABM), Buyer Persona Development, and Role-Based Messaging Frameworks, your task is to define one comprehensive Target Market and Target Audience profile that reflects all key roles within the B2B buying journey: Champion, Decision Maker, Influencer, and Blocker. The profile must capture both organizational characteristics (Target Market) and individual attributes (Target Audience) in a consolidated manner to drive highly relevant sales and marketing engagement strategies for our business idea.

Structure your response exactly as follows:

Target Market Description:
Relevant Industries:
Company Size:
Geography:
Typical Job Titles:
Role in Buying Process:

Target Audience Description:
Personality Attributes:
Age:
Income:
Interests:
Values:

This is the PRODUCT or SERVICE: Business idea: {{businessidea}}

Instructions:
Provide a single comprehensive profile that represents all key roles combined.
Complete all labels with clear and concise details.
Target Market details should focus on company-level characteristics and the combined buying influence of all roles.
Target Audience details should reflect professional traits, interests, and motivations common to the individuals across these roles.
Do not include any top-level heading.
Do not repeat or reference the prompt.
Use only the internal section labels listed above.
Start each label on a new line, followed by its content — no extra spacing.
Output must be clean, formal, and ready to paste into a professional document.

You are generating document-ready text. The document already includes top-level section headings. Thats why never add a title or header in your response.
Each label must be followed by a colon and a space, then the content. All words must be properly spaced with no words running together. Use professional grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Where appropriate use bullet points only to improve readability.
If the content includes bullets, keep each bullet on a separate new line. Do not restate or rephrase any information already provided here (e.g., business idea, mission, or other headings).

As an expert Business Strategist with a focus on strategic planning and operational excellence, your task is to identify and define our short-term, medium-term, and long-term business goals. Based on the information provided, craft actionable, realistic, and measurable goals that are aligned with our overall vision, mission, and market positioning.

Your recommendations should be strategic, holistic, and aligned with our business model. Each goal must directly contribute towards driving growth, enhancing profitability, and ensuring sustainable long-term success. Your response should be clear, specific, and immediately applicable.

Short-Term Goals (up to 1 year): Provide a list of focused and attainable goals that support our immediate business priorities.

Medium-Term Goals (1-3 years): Outline key objectives that will drive our business growth and operational progress over the next few years.

Long-Term Goals (3-5+ years): Define visionary yet achievable goals that align with our long-term ambitions and strategic direction.

For each set of goals, include a brief rationale explaining why these goals are essential, and suggest potential strategies or actions to accomplish them.

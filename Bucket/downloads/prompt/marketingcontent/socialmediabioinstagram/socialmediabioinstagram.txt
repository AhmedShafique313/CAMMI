You are generating document-ready text. The document already includes top-level section headings. Thatâ€™s why never add a title or header in your response.
Each label must be followed by a colon and a space, then the content. All words must be properly spaced with no words running together. Use professional grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Where appropriate, use bullet points only to improve readability.
If the content includes bullets, keep each bullet on a separate new line. Do not restate or rephrase any information already provided here (e.g., business idea, mission, or other headings).

As an expert Social Media Copywriter with a deep understanding of brand positioning and audience psychology, your task is to craft a high-impact Instagram bio for our brand. The bio must succinctly capture the essence of our business idea, reflect our unique value proposition, and instantly resonate with our target personas. Your copy should evoke trust, relevance, and a sense of belonging for our audience, driving curiosity and engagement while remaining consistent with our brand voice. The character limit is 100, so every word must be intentional and aligned with our growth objectives. Include a subtle call to action that encourages interaction or conversion.

For this task, consider the following information:

Business Idea: {{businessidea}}

Brand Voice: {{brandguidelines}}
Target Personas: {{buyerpersonas}}

Provide a concise answer within the 100-character limit.

Total Addressable Market (TAM): Based on the target market description and relevant industries, the TAM encompasses mid-sized to large B2B enterprises across diverse sectors such as technology, professional services, manufacturing, healthcare, and financial services. With an estimated 1.2 million companies fitting this profile globally, and an average annual marketing spend of $50,000 per company, the TAM can be approximated at $60 billion in potential revenue.

Serviceable Available Market (SAM): Considering our initial geographical focus on North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions, as well as the operational capacity to serve companies with 100 to 10,000 employees, the SAM narrows down to approximately 500,000 companies. With an average annual marketing spend of $75,000 for this segment, the SAM is estimated at $37.5 billion.

Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): In the early stages, we can realistically target a 1% market share within the SAM, factoring in competition, brand awareness, and market entry barriers. This translates to a SOM of $375 million in potential revenue, representing a conservative yet achievable goal for our initial market penetration.

We recommend adopting a tiered subscription pricing model, offering different package options based on the number of templates accessed and additional features. This approach allows us to cater to diverse customer needs while maintaining competitive pricing.

To provide added value, we could consider bundling complementary services, such as marketing consulting or training resources, with higher-tier subscription plans. This strategy not only enhances our offerings but also creates opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.

Social media campaigns, targeted advertising, and influencer collaborations can also be effective in reaching our target audience and fostering engagement. Offering free trial periods or limited-time discounts could incentivize potential customers to experience our platform firsthand.

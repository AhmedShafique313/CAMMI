## Most Important KPI: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) growth

MRR growth is a crucial KPI that measures the recurring revenue generated from subscriptions on a monthly basis. To calculate MRR growth, we need to track the total subscription revenue at the end of each month and compare it to the previous month's MRR. This KPI provides insights into the platform's ability to acquire new customers and retain existing ones.

We should closely monitor MRR growth to ensure that our marketing efforts, product offerings, and customer retention strategies are effective. Positive MRR growth indicates a healthy business, while stagnant or declining MRR may signal issues that need to be addressed. MRR growth should be a key factor in decision-making processes related to product development, pricing strategies, and marketing initiatives.

## Second Most Important KPI: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

CAC represents the total cost incurred in acquiring a new customer, including marketing expenses, sales efforts, and other related costs. To calculate CAC, we need to divide the total cost of acquiring customers within a specific period by the number of new customers acquired during that same period.

Monitoring CAC is crucial for understanding the efficiency of our marketing and sales efforts. A lower CAC indicates that our customer acquisition strategies are cost-effective, while a higher CAC may suggest the need for optimization or a reevaluation of our approach.

CAC should be a key consideration when making decisions related to marketing campaigns, sales strategies, and customer acquisition channels. By aiming to reduce CAC over time, we can improve the overall profitability and scalability of our business.

## Third Most Important KPI: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

CLV represents the total revenue a customer is expected to generate throughout their relationship with our platform. To calculate CLV, we need to consider factors such as the average subscription duration, revenue per customer, and customer churn rate.

CLV is a critical KPI for understanding the long-term value of our customer base and the potential return on investment from customer acquisition efforts. A higher CLV indicates that our customers are deriving significant value from our platform, leading to longer retention and higher overall revenue.

CLV should guide decision-making related to customer retention strategies, product enhancements, and pricing models. By focusing on increasing CLV, we can prioritize initiatives that foster customer loyalty, reduce churn, and maximize the lifetime value of each customer relationship.
